# 10 mini projects with Java

**Project 01**

A java program that reads integers (range 1 -49) from a file, sorts them then exports 
groups of six numbers to a file according to the following criteria - each group should:
- contain max. 4 even numbers
- contain max. 4 even numbers
- have 2 continuous numbers at max
- have no more than 3 numbers ending with the same digit
- have no more than 3 numbers within the same tens


**Project 02**

A Contacts app that can store up to 500 contacts.
Functions include searching, adding, updating and deleting a contact.


**Project 03**

A program that reads the charactes of a text file and exports statistics 
about the character count number, sorted by character and appear frequency.


**Project 04**

A program that reads data of a vehicle arrival and departure time and 
determines the max number of vehicles parked at the same time.


**Project 05**

A program that identfies the lowest and highest position of an input number from a sorted table
eg. {0, 1, 4, 4,4, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9}, input = 8, lowest pos = 7, highest pos = 10


**Project 06**

A program that identifies the maximum sum subarray from a table of integers.
eg. {−2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1,−5, 4} -> the contiguous sub array with max sum is the  {4, −1, 2, 1}, sum is 6


**Project 07**

A program that showcases how a shallow copy and deep copy of a 2D table works.

**Project 08**

A game of tic tac toe

**Project 09**

An encryprion & decryption program that :
- encodes the first character of a message with its ASCII value 
- encodes the rest of the charactes by 
a) adding the ASCII value of the this and the previous characters 
b) dividing the sum with an encryption key.
The message ends with the symbol #.

**Project 10**

A theatre seat management program. Each seat has a row letter and a numner.
Can book or cancel a seat.
